#Mathematical Expression Evaluator
============================



A Mathematical Expression Evaluator is actually a calculator for basic math expressions such as 3 * 5 + 2. Two different approaches for solving this problem are implemented. One approach is based on a stack while the other one is based on a tree. In addition, a different approach of the stack implementation is introduced using the Flyweight Pattern. While for the Tree based implementation a new approach is introduced with an alternative Visitor Pattern and a different approach of the Tree building and evaluation. All algorithms are implemented in C++ with various Patterns such as Abstract Factory, Iterator and Command Pattern for the stack implementation while Visitor, Composite and Builder Patterns are used for the tree based implementation. The input for all algorithms is an infix expression with a space between every string, for instance 3 + 4 * ( 4 % 2). The operators that the algorithms can evaluate are +,-,*,/ and % while the numbers must be integers, negative or positive.
